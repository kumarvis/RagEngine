## Rag Engine for Documents

Here’s a detailed task breakdown to help you structure your Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework for querying a set of PDF documents:

# RAG Framework for PDF Querying - To-Do List

## 1. Data Preparation and Ingestion
- [ ] **Task 1.1:** Extract text from PDFs and preprocess (e.g., clean and structure the text).
- [ ] **Task 1.2:** Convert structured text into a suitable format for indexing (e.g., splitting into chunks).
- [ ] **Task 1.3:** Store preprocessed documents in a document storage system (e.g., vector database or traditional database).

## 2. Embedding Generation and Storage
- [ ] **Task 2.1:** Select or fine-tune a pre-trained model to generate embeddings.
- [ ] **Task 2.2:** Generate embeddings for document chunks.
- [ ] **Task 2.3:** Store embeddings in a vector database for efficient retrieval.

## 3. Retrieval Mechanism
- [ ] **Task 3.1:** Design the retrieval pipeline to query document embeddings and retrieve relevant chunks.
- [ ] **Task 3.2:** Implement similarity search using the vector database.
- [ ] **Task 3.3:** Test retrieval accuracy and optimize for performance.

## 4. Augmentation of Query with Retrieved Content
- [ ] **Task 4.1:** Develop a module to append retrieved document context to the query.
- [ ] **Task 4.2:** Experiment with different retrieval strategies (e.g., top-k retrieval).
- [ ] **Task 4.3:** Fine-tune the augmentation process to ensure it provides meaningful context to the model.

## 5. Generative Model Integration
- [ ] **Task 5.1:** Select a suitable generative model (e.g., OpenAI’s GPT, BERT-based models).
- [ ] **Task 5.2:** Integrate the model to accept the augmented query and generate answers.
- [ ] **Task 5.3:** Test and optimize response quality by adjusting the input format and prompt engineering.

## 6. Evaluation and Fine-Tuning
- [ ] **Task 6.1:** Define evaluation metrics (e.g., relevance, accuracy).
- [ ] **Task 6.2:** Conduct a series of test queries to assess output quality.
- [ ] **Task 6.3:** Tune retrieval and generation parameters based on evaluation results.

## 7. Interface and User Experience (Optional)
- [ ] **Task 7.1:** Build a simple API endpoint for querying the system.
- [ ] **Task 7.2:** Develop a user interface (if applicable) for querying and displaying results.
- [ ] **Task 7.3:** Implement logging and monitoring to track usage and identify areas for improvement.

## 8. Documentation and Deployment
- [ ] **Task 8.1:** Document code and usage instructions.
- [ ] **Task 8.2:** Deploy the framework (e.g., containerize with Docker, set up on a cloud platform).
- [ ] **Task 8.3:** Monitor deployment for performance and scalability needs.


### 8. **Documentation and Deployment**
   - **Task 8.1:** Document code and usage instructions.
   - **Task 8.2:** Deploy the framework (e.g., containerize with Docker, set up on a cloud platform).
   - **Task 8.3:** Monitor deployment for performance and scalability needs.

Each of these tasks can be estimated individually based on your experience with each step or specific tools involved. Let me know if you'd like help with setting specific time estimates!
